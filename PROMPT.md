Please review and fully understand the two .md files located in the documents/ folder.

After reading them, reply with:

A concise summary of what the app/modules are supposed to do

A checklist of the UI screens/components and routes that need to exist

Any missing details, inconsistencies, or assumptions you had to make

A proposed implementation order (by module/screen), optimized for building with mock data

Important constraints:

For now, everything should use the provided mock data only.

No real backend/API calls yet. Anything that would normally require API calls (especially auth) should be implemented as UI-only flow so testers can click through end-to-end.

Focus on a polished, correct UI and complete navigation/routing between pages.

Treat this as “functioning UI” work: state, form validation (if needed), loading/empty states (mocked), and smooth transitions, but no real network integration.

Once you confirm understanding and list what needs to be done, I’ll tell you which module to implement first (one at a time).
