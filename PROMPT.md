Read the chat-interactive-plan.md and the 8 phases there with details, and chat-interactive-plan-implmentation.md under documents folder and udnerstand whats there (read my code base and related files to solidify your understanding). Once you think and understand, start the phase 8 as I beleive phase 1 to 7 has been done. Once you are done with phase 8 (build passes, lint passes, etc), Update and add onto documentation called chat-interactive-plan-implmentation.md under documents folder. Where you will add every single step that was done, in details and the status of the phase and such. So when a new AI model picks this work up, will exactly know what was done and what to do next.
